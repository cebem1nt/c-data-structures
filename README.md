# C data structures 
A repository with impleemntations of a bunch of different data structures. Use as you want.

## TODO

- [x] Linked list
- [x] Binary Search Tree (BST)
- [x] AVL Tree
- [ ] ~~Sets (Sorted array based)~~ Just use avl / rb tree. 
- [ ] Heap (min/max)
- [x] Map (tree based)
- [x] Hashmap 
- [x] Hashset
- [ ] Red-Black Tree (Real boss fight)
- [ ] Graphs (Hell, how is it working, I'm scared)
